    ">For some, knowing state average test scores is fun trivia: my state is the best and smartest.  But for many students and parents, knowing state average SAT / ACT scores can be critical. For students applying for scholarships, many scholarships are more competitive in \"smarter\" states. For students who want to compare themselves to their in-state peers, the scores above are also very useful. For families thinking of moving states, they may want to make sure their target state has a good education system. For researchers and education designers, this data helps them see which state systems are working and which ones may be failing."

    "The SAT and ACT are standardized tests that many colleges and universities in the United States require for their admissions process. This score is used along with other materials such as grade point average (GPA) and essay responses to determine whether or not a potential student will be accepted to the university.\n",

    "The SAT has two sections of the test: Evidence-Based Reading and Writing and Math ([*source*](https://www.princetonreview.com/college/sat-sections)). The ACT has 4 sections: English, Mathematics, Reading, and Science, with an additional optional writing section ([*source*](https://www.act.org/content/act/en/products-and-services/the-act/scores/understanding-your-scores.html)). They have different score ranges, which you can read more about on their websites or additional outside sources (a quick Google search will help you understand the scores for each test):\n",

    "Standardized tests have long been a controversial topic for students, administrators, and legislators. Since the 1940's, an increasing number of colleges have been using scores from sudents' performances on tests like the SAT and the ACT as a measure for college readiness and aptitude ([*source*](https://www.minotdailynews.com/news/local-news/2017/04/a-brief-history-of-the-sat-and-act/)). Supporters of these tests argue that these scores can be used as an objective measure to determine college admittance. Opponents of these tests claim that these tests are not accurate measures of students potential or ability and serve as an inequitable barrier to entry. Lately, more and more schools are opting to drop the SAT/ACT requirement for their Fall 2021 applications ([*read more about this here*](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/14/us/coronavirus-colleges-sat-act-test-trnd/index.html))."

    "## **Conclusion And Recommendations:** \n",
    "\n",
    "* The ACT and SAT participation distributions roughly mirror each other, with states tending to prefer one test or the other. ACT shows a large group of highly committed states, and a higher baseline participation nationwide. SAT shows a larger group of states with 50-80% participation, as well as a smaller set of highly committed states. The ACT has been doing quite well.\n",
    "* ACT and SAT scores are inversely correlated with their respective participation rates. This is likely due to selection bias, as low participation means those who are participating tend to be higher achieving, and high participation means diluted quality of performance.\n",
    "There are strong regional (and possibly political) affiliations associated with ACT versus SAT preference. Coastal progressive states tend to favor the SAT, while Midwestern and Mountain conservative states tend to favor the ACT.\n",
    "* The SAT made clear gains in 2018 relative to the ACT. The states making these gains tended to be states in the 10-15% participation range, at the upper edge of the lower bloc, or in the 70% range, at the upper edge of the middle bloc, in the distribution of SAT participation by state. Targeting states in similar positions in the 2018 distribution should be promising for the College Board moving forward.\n",
